# latex-includetikz
Latex package to include external tikz figures and similarly to \includegraphics command.

# Install

Add `includetikz` in your current directory, or texmf install. 
Then add
```
\usepackage[<options>]{includetikz}
```
in your text source.

#### Package options:

Option | Description
--- | ---
[external] | Compute all include tikz as external pdf files with checksum (see tikz external library).
[origin]   | Compute all pdf picture in a subdirectory "autogen" under the original figure directory (Default will use the source directory ).
[force]    | Force all tikz figures to be recompiled (Slower build).
[disable]  | Disable all pictures and replace by a black picture (Faster build).
[optimize] | Optimize generated pdf.

# Usage

Create you tikz figures in a separate file then include them in your tex source using
```
\includetikz[<options>]{path/to/image.tikz}
```
Tikz PDFs are generated by default under a new directory called "autogen" in the source directory. You can change
the emplacement using the "origin" for each figure.

NB: .tikz or .tex extension work.

```

#### FAQS

*I get an MD5 write error `I can't write on file `figs/.md5'.*

This often happens when you output files in another directory using the
latex option `-output-directory=<workdir>`.
The easier solution is to create a simlink inside the working directory.
See the providen example.
