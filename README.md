# latex-includetikz
Latex package to include external tikz figures and similarly to \includegraphics command.

# Install

Add `includetikz` in your current directory, or texmf install. 
Then add
```tex
\usepackage[<options>]{includetikz}
```
in your text source.

#### Package options:

Option | Description
--- | ---
[external] | Compute all include tikz as external pdf files with checksum (see tikz external library).
[origin]   | Compute all pdf picture in a subdirectory "autogen" under the original figure directory (Default will use the source directory ).
[force]    | Force all tikz figures to be recompiled (Slower build).
[disable]  | Disable all pictures and replace by a black picture (Faster build).
[optimize] | Optimize generated pdf.

# Usage

Create you tikz figures in a separate file then include them in your tex source using
```
\includetikz[<options>]{path/to/image.tikz}
```
Tikz PDFs are generated by default under a new directory called "autogen" in the source directory. You can change
the default path using the option "origin" to create this directory relative to each figure directory.

NB: .tikz or .tex extension work.

#### Options

Option         | valuetype | Description
---            | ---       | ---
[scale]        | float     | Scale the tikz image
[font keepratio]    | X         | Scale the image and inverse scale font size
[font scale]   | float     | Scale tikz image font
[font style]   | string    | Tikz image font style (beta)
[fill opacity] | float     | Modify image opacity (beta)

#### Commands:

Command | Description
--- | ---
`\includetikzdisable` | Disable all pictures (to make compilation faster)
`\includetikzorigin` | Change autogen path to figure origin directory
`\includetikzforcerebuild` | Force tikz picture to be recompiled

#### Examples:

Minimal example:
```
% Preamble.
\usepackage{includetizk}

% Document.
\includetikz[scale=0.9]{figs/monimage.tikz}
```
Generate monimage.tikz during first compilation, then use auto-generated pdf:
```
% Preamble.
\usepackage[external]{includetizk}

% Document.
\includetikz[font scale=1.3]{figs/monimage.tikz}
```

#### FAQS

###### *I get an MD5 write error `I can't write on file `figs/.md5'.*

This often happens when you output files in another directory using the
latex option `-output-directory=<workdir>`.
The easier solution is to create a simlink inside the working directory.
See the providen example.

###### *I want to replace tikz picture by pdf*

This is one of the goal of this package.
Compile your latex file the first time to generate all tikz pictures.
Then comment the includetikz lines and replace them by the `\includegraphics` function:
```tex
%\usepackage{includetikz}
\usepackage{graphicx}

%\includetikz[scale=0.5]{path/to/fig/figname-1}
\includegraphics{autogen/figname-1-n0} 

%\includetikz[scale=0.5]{path/to/fig/figname-1}
\includegraphics{autogen/figname-1-n1}

%\includetikz[scale=0.5]{path/to/fig/figname-2}
\includegraphics{autogen/figname-2-n0} 
```
Note that all generated picture are suffixed by `-nX` where X represent the nth call of the same figure.
(This is necessary for the case where the same picture is generated with different options)
If the origin option is passed then the path would be `path/to/fig/autogen/` instead of `autogen/`.
